# Project: Create a Proxy Class
#
# In this assignment, create a proxy class (one is started for you
# below).  You should be able to initialize the proxy object with any
# object.  Any messages sent to the proxy object should be forwarded
# to the target object.  As each message is sent, the proxy should
# record the name of the method sent.
#
# The proxy class is started for you.  You will need to add a method
# missing handler and any other supporting methods.  The specification
# of the Proxy class is given in the AboutProxyObjectProject koan.

class Proxy
  def initialize(target_object)
    @object = target_object
    # ADD MORE CODE HERE
  end

  # WRITE CODE HERE
end

# The proxy object should pass the following Koan:
#
class AboutProxyObjectProject < Neo::Koan
  def test_proxy_method_returns_wrapped_object
    # NOTE: The Television class is defined below
    tv = Proxy.new(Television.new)

    # HINT: Proxy class is defined above, may need tweaking...

    assert tv.instance_of?(Proxy)
  end
